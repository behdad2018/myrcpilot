/**
 * <setpoint_manager.h>
 *
 * @brief      Setpoint manager runs at the same rate as the feedback controller
 *             and is the interface between the user inputs (input manager) and
 *             the feedback controller setpoint. currently it contains very
 *             simply logic and runs very quickly which is why it's okay to run
 *             in the feedback ISR right before the feedback controller. In the
 *             future this is where go-home and other higher level autonomy will
 *             live.
 *
 *             This serves to allow the feedback controller to be as simple and
 *             clean as possible by putting all high-level manipulation of the
 *             setpoints here. Then feedback-controller only needs to march the
 *             filters and zero them out when arming or enabling controllers
